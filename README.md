Files for Bacteria Warfare!

Your job is to keep the bacteria from going down the plughole. You can repel them (if they are a different colour to you) or lure them away by creating mushrooms of their colour.

CNTRL to change colour.
SPACE to lay a mushroom.
Arrow keys to navigate.

This game was created for the [Global Game Jam 2010](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2010/bacterial-warfare) by me (Anna Shipman), Dave Sapien, Donald Hutchison and Razvan Mocanu.

It was created using Flex, but it seems that we put everything in the com directory. I am not sure why we did that. Still, there are tests! Not bad for a 48-hour hack :)
